Toxic environment

Good work life balance, slow when it comes to career advancement and growth opportunities.
Senior Software Engineer (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 7 mars 2022
The org behaves like a typical cost centre for the bank and focus is mostly on saving operational costs, so you will be having a lot of cost conversations. A side effect of this mindset is that they end up selecting cheaper tools sometimes, which are not really the best option.

Great place to work with great people
Communications Associate (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 29 mai 2021
Amazing people, and lots of support from colleagues and managers. Senior management really does have an open-door policy and you get a lot of opportunities to work with them directly. The work/life balance is great, and they really care about their people. They are also doing a lot around diversity and inclusion and integrating it into the business and culture. There are also lots of comprehensive training and development opportunities provided by the company.

Would strongly recommend joining an ERG as it's a great way to work with people from different departments and senior leadership. If you speak French it really helps but is not at all required.
Points positifs
The people, international opportunities, commitment to D&I, work/life balance

Great learning experience
Vice President (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 14 avril 2021
Overall good learning experience and promotion is reasonable per the performance.

Culture is collaborative and inclusive. The experience will also vary largely with managers and teams.

However, the atmosphere is getting more intense with restructuring and cost cutting. Employees are given more work without competitive salary or salary increase. Stress level and turnover rate have increased significantly in some teams.

The operation with headquarter is not organized- it can be a waste of efficiency and productivity sometimes. Have to rush for deadlines and directions are not clearly defined or can change constantly without proper communication.

Pros and Cons
VP (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 8 avril 2021
Good work life balance and the people are nice to wok with. Benefits are better than other foreign banks. However, there’s been a lot of cost cutting the past 3 years. A lot of layoffs, and low employee morale. European workers are protected by unions, so US employees are subject to getting cut first. Understaffed. They try to innovate with new technology but failure to execute to perform roll outs successfully.
Points positifs
Good work life balance. Good benefits, 8% match up to 10k. 27 days off, and 32 days off after 5 years.
Points négatifs
Performs worse than rival banks. Lots of cost cutting and near shoring jobs to Montreal.

Decent company with average growth and hikes
Lead Software Engineer (employé actuel) - Remote - 27 septembre 2020
Since I was working with the new team, got opportunity to work on the latest technology and tools. Got average of 8-10% hike every year with a promotion after 3 years. There is a cap on the number of people who can be promoted every year in a team. You have to really stand out from the crowd for that. The technology used in some teams can be out dated and you may be bored of working after some time. The happiness quotient depends on what you want from the company. Have seen many people stick on to the company for many years. Really up to the individual to decide for himself

Reasonable work/life balance, great benefits and fosters a diverse, interesting culture
Associate (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 28 mai 2020
My experience after 3 plus years of working at SG has been rewarding: I've been exposed to many different areas of the bank within my work that's helped me learn about different topics and progress my career.

Work/life balance is relatively pretty fair for a bank. Generous benefits package and really enjoy working with people that come from all walks of life in my team. Management can be unreasonably stubborn over certain things but partly because of the inherent local disconnects of a transnational company that has operations in almost every country on Earth. This disconnect also bleeds over to systems and the disparate nature between different groups in the Bank. However, it is clear there is an effort to take employee's thoughts/concerns into account about how to make things better, at least on my team.
Points positifs

The worst workplace I ever experienced in my 16 years professional
Brokerage Analyst (ancien employé) - Chicago, IL - 23 mars 2020
Day one I worked there and I told my husband that I have to find another job.
There was 0 training at place, people who were working in my department was doing the job in wrong direction and every week they had to fix the GL account they involved wrong first place.
My manager was the worst of all, when I was asking her questions she was not responsive AT ALL or she was telling me to wait and was laughing with other managers on something else. The working hours was unreasonable, she was asking me to come around 7 in the morning and leave at 7 pm. It was horrible, and she was not helping me to accomplish any phase, because she was postponing everything.
There was an obvious problem in the process and nobody was fixing it.
The knowledge in the system was very low or non. when I was asking people, they were telling me they don't know. My manager even was telling me she doesn't know. She literally told me once not to trust anyone, cause nobody knows what they are doing.
I left the company soon enough and found another job for myself, but I heard that people started to leave that brokerage department very soon. The whole department of Brokerage had a lack of human respect.

SGCIB AME suffers from the fundamental flaw that it is a regional offshoot of a French universal bank, and though it is successful here, it must compensate for the losses and failures of the mothership in Paris. They essentially have their hands tied and are not empowered to make many key decisions on policy or personnel.

That said, there are some great people at SocGen and many of them want to win. When an issue is focused on, it is generally solved. They will spend money when they have to.

My experience may not be representative of others'. They do the best they can. It is probably better if one is in France, and certainly if one is an employee of the firm. (They have a high reliance on consultants, whose status is uncertain.)
Points positifs
Follows every new technology trend; attempts to provide amenities
Points négatifs
Treatment of people is unsatisfactory as demonstrated by high turnover among FTEs

Great Place for a first internship
Summer Analyst (ancien employé) - New York, NY; Jersey City, NJ - 19 juin 2019
I was an intern for ITEC, in a class of about 90 interns. However, about 8 of us were with ITEC. The first week was training, which consisted of an overview of what the bank does and certain aspects of banking. I learned a lot of banking that I didn't in school but, I felt that there should have been a specific training for ITEC interns as our work may or may not involve that.

I found out at the end of the last week I would be working in Jersey City but, I did spend some days in NYC based on the events they prepared for us. The pay was great, however, a majority of the time there I didn't have much to do. My team was very busy with their own tasks and I didn't get that many projects. Every single employee I met, no matter the level, was very kind, welcoming, helpful, and willing to answer any of my questions. My boss was also amazing.

The program had free lunches every Friday where someone in the company would talk about their experience in the company and provide background for their department. We also had a bowling night and a soulcycle class. It was a great place to work, especially since it was my first.

I did feel that there was some confusion when it came to certain events. In the beginning, I didn't know where I would be working or my manager until later on in the week. However, HR did have to take care of all 90 interns.

I can't speak for the rest of the interns but, for ITEC, full time offers were given to half of the interns. I was not one of them and I was upset but, it was truly a wonderful experience. I truly enjoyed working there!

Interesting Company
KYC (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 19 février 2019
SOC GEN has a HS type of setting, the most popular student gets away with everything even if they are ultimately wrong. They play favoritism, gossip A LOT about one another and do not hesitate to throw one another under the bus if they don't like you. Certain departments have a lot of messy in it, the focus should collectively be ensuring all standards, policies and procedures are met. Yet they spend more time trying to damage others careers. SOC GEN also has a VERY high turn over rate. Some of the most talented people are let go simply because its about who you know not what you know.

The crazy thing is, there is so much work to be done, and its never boring work. If people could put their personal feelings for one another to the side it would be a fabulous company

However, different ad-hoc requests come up throughout the day, mainly from the front office. Being on a trading floor as the go-to person for anything Finance makes me very accessible to the traders and COOs who are always asking for information. It makes the job exciting and challenging at the same time.

Market Risk Officer, Cross Asset Risk (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 5 septembre 2018
Great people but they do not have any concept of a work-life balance and 12-14 hour days of all staff is the norm. While they stress the development of the employment, I and dozens of others were laid off in a reorganization without any opportunity to even place us within the firm's many open positions in other divisions.
Points positifs
Good extra-curricular activities
Points négatifs
Could not participate in many SG related activities as deadlines in department were tough, Lower compensation than other similar banks. Horrific work life balance

As a contractor it was a great place to work
Project Manager CCAR (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 17 août 2018
This was one of my favorite jobs (contract) that I ever had. I worked in a great environment with great people on both the professional and personal level. I was encouraged and rewarded for stepping up and contributing across the project. The only reason that I did not give this job 5 stars was because the project was terminated one quarter through it's expected term and I did not get a heads up until 4 weeks after the decision was made. Overall though a great place to work.

As everywhere else you will work with some smart and exciting people but the majority of junior level employee I've worked with share the same sentiment of global boredom.

Innovative ideas are welcome but not often pursued, process and hierarchy are very heavy, outdated. Atmosphere is neither bad nor exciting.

My pay was perfect for me but the stress was very high (almost unhealthy) & the turn around for employees was high also. Lots of changes often & management was confused on how to operate processes & procedure since there was no structure (whether it was admitted or not).

The time spent at SG was focused entirely on obtaining our primary dealership status and integrating our business into the main office in Paris. Management was skilled in derivatives, but not in the product set we were building out in the Americas. The markets were different, the players were different and the competetion was different than what they experienced back in Europe. The hardest part of the job was staying focus on our goals and objectives as senior management changed constantly. We ultimately become a primary dealer and were able to hire people and build out a team.

No future.
Broker (ancien employé) - Chicago, IL - 27 septembre 2017
Societe Generale is all about headcount. The minute they took over 100%, they started letting people go. The head count went from 1250 to under 400 in about a year. Now I think the head count is below 250. The majority of the jobs went overseas. I believe the majority of them went to Bangalore, India. Some went to Europe and Australia.

Management was poor. No direction whatsoever. No possibility of advancement. There was no attempt to find a similar role in another department. Outplacement was minimal and internet based. This method of cutting staff to the bare minimum is something they are well known for.

If you really need the job, take it, but you should have an eye out for something better at all times.

Opportunity to take more responsibility and compensation
Consultant (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 15 août 2017
Since its a non-US bank, the compensation and rate is higher to attract talented professionals. There is lot of opportunity to take senior roles if you are driven. Small set up was great for networking with the entire organization.

Technology an tools are a bit dated, limited exposure compared to other banks.

There are a lot of opportunities to apply innovate ideas to the projects you work on and to take what you have learned and apply it across various tasks. The hardest part of the job is being able to apply both technical skills and qualitative thoughts to the models you use and how to apply them to various presentations.

Stay away from this company
Reg reporting (ancien employé) - Jersey City, NJ - 26 avril 2017
I can see why this company gets bad reviews and is going downhill. Went on a first interview in Jersey City… went great. So great there was a second, follow up interview with product controller, MD, and CFO the next week. CFO tells me I will be interviewed by HR , the following week which is normal protocol before an offer is made. I email their HR dept, no response. I call HR and the Director who interviewed me in the first round. Again, no response after 3 weeks. I'm sure they felt im wasting their time with courtesy follow ups, but its my time they wasted and were so rude and unprofessional to not even at least respond that they found someone else or did not feel I was qualified. Negative feedback is better than no feedback. My experience with them shows alot about their job culture and inconsideration they probably show to their own employees. Stay away.

SG is the investment bank that doesn't kill it's people
Vice President of Information Technology (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 14 mai 2016
Compared to the historical perception of the investment bank as a bank that subjects its people routinely to 80 or 90 hour weeks, at SG, the expectation is you work pretty much a normal day. Except during very busy project time periods, the office generally is pretty cleared out by 5:30 or so, and people have a relatively good work life balance. The culture is very good, however, sometimes overly bureaucratic. Benefits are outstanding, though pay will lag behind, but what you lose in pay, you'll get back in quality of life. If I didn't have other plans for the future, I certainly would be staying here.

First time experience working in a bank, location was very close to home.
Branch Manager Assistant (ancien employé) - El sherouk City branch - 16 mars 2015
It was my first experience working in National Societe General Bank( El shorouk City Branch), handling bank databases and many transactions, under the supervision of the branch manager.
I worked in the banking field where I dealt with everyday customer’s service and providing all necessary information needed for the bank’s up to date deals.
The hardest part is that sometimes Ive dealt with customers' anger and I was always taking full responsibility to find closest solution and looking for quick resolutions as it was very important for me to gain customer satisfaction and trust.
Actually It has been a great experience to understand how to act in a quick response and I gained a lot from time management to team working and knowing more from my coworkers as they were far experienced in the job.

SG overall was a good company. As with all companies it has it benefits and areas that need improvement. With my position I had set hours and was able to work with my manager to make adjustments for my personal life if need be. Please note in this review I can only speak to the manager I had while working there and not all the other ones. I had an exceptional manager and was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with them. Due to that my experience was a good one. They were always there to walk me through things I may not understand, but also trusted me with my daily tasks that would range from answering calls to doing expense reports to creating and editing presentations. Because I am personable there were very few if any co-workers/peers that I did not get along with. I am not sure there was a real hard part of my job and I enjoyed most of it because of the people I was able to be working along side.

shooting own goals
credit (employé actuel) - New York, NY - 13 juin 2012
I've been with the bank for over 10 years and it has survived a number of close calls. Energy blow up, Kerviel, Greece. Unfortunately, the bank is its own worst enemy. Recent management changes, especially in risk where I work, have left many of us scratching our heads. The people Paris has put in charge over here have lost the confidence of the line. We had high hopes that with an American CEO from a bulge bracket firm, things would change, but they've just gotten worse. Moving across town to an office space where senior credit officers will loose their desks and their privacy is not helping morale. On the bright side, no one works much past 5:30 or 6 and no weekends.
Points positifs
easy hours
Points négatifs
clueless management, especially in risk

Very poor job security and poor management.
xxxx (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 16 mai 2012
It was my worst job ever working in Societe Generale.
The bank has a Korean Manager who knows nothing and he's very sneaky. But, He was good in talking big and kissing up the management.

Fast-faced & challenging, great place to sharpen technical wit
ELECTRONIC TRADE SUPPORT (ancien employé) - New York, NY - 27 mars 2012
Don't let the calm before 9:30 fool you: after that point, the place jumps with shouting traders and scrambling support staff anxious to ensure the most fluid technical work environment.
